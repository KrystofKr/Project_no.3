# Project_no.3


I need help of the internet with geometry. I approached this project  like this --> I watched tutorial --> I understanded whats what --> I recreated the game with as little peeking to source as possible. When I get stuck, I prefere to found solution in different source then watch tutorial again. I feel like I could do better with this project but its like half of year old. So I will let it be as I left it to remind me that I can do better.
